# bhAi Application Development Blueprint

This document is the definitive and single source of truth for the development of the bhAi application. It outlines the project's vision, technology stack, data models, UI/UX flows, a detailed milestone-based development plan, and our collaborative workflow.

---

## Part 1: Project Overview & Vision

### 1.1 Application Name
**bhAi**

### 1.2 Project Mandate
To build a hyperlocal Q&A and micro-services marketplace at "god speed" using a Flutter-based, AI-native architecture. The application must be a Progressive Web App (PWA) and support Android and iOS, leveraging Firebase for its backend services.

### 1.3 Core Pillars
*   **AI-Native Architecture**: The AI provides the first reply to a query, with a human "Node" confirming for local truth.
*   **Credits Economy**: A system with three credit types: **Cash** (purchased via Cashfree, withdrawable), **Bonus** (non-withdrawable promos, consumed first), and **Locked** (escrow).
*   **Trust Score Framework**: A dynamic `users.trust_score` influences user privileges and is updated based on in-app actions.
*   **Three-Way Dispute Resolution**: A workflow to handle disputes with three outcomes: **Refund to Asker**, **Award to Answerer**, or **Split**.
*   **Location-Native Features**: Integration with Google Maps for geo-anchored queries and services.

### 1.4 Target Platforms
*   Web (Progressive Web App - PWA)
*   Android
*   iOS

    *   `wallets` and `transactions` can only be written to by server-side functions.
    *   Sensitive fields (`phone`, `upi_id`) are protected from client-side writes.
*   **My Action: Database Indexing**: Create composite indexes to ensure query performance:
    *   `queries(status, category, city, created_at desc)`
    *   `queries(status, location)`
    *   `answers(qid, status)`
    *   `transactions(uid, created_at desc)`

## Part 5: Development Milestones & Iterations

### **Milestone 1: Foundation & Multi-Factor Authentication**
*   **Objective**: Set up the project, data models, and implement a robust authentication system with Google Sign-in, Email/Password, and Phone OTP, including account linking.
*   **My Actions**:
    1.  Define all Firestore collections and security rules as per Part 3.
    2.  Implement UI and logic for all three authentication providers.
    3.  Implement Firebase's account linking feature to merge anonymous or separate accounts into one unified user profile.
    4.  Create the basic UI layout differentiating guest/authenticated views.
*   **Your Actions**: Review data models; provide Firebase config with all three auth providers enabled.
*   **Testing**: Integration tests for each login method; test that signing in with a second method correctly links to the existing account.
*   **Discussion**: "Milestone 1 complete. We have a foundational app with a flexible and secure authentication system. Ready to implement the AI-assisted query flow?"

### **Milestone 2: AI-Assisted Query Flow**
*   **Objective**: To implement the sophisticated, two-step query process where the AI assists the user in formatting their question for human Nodes.
*   **My Actions**:
    1.  **User Input**: Build the `AskQueryForm` for users to input their raw, natural language question.
    2.  **AI Processing (Cloud Function)**: On submission, trigger a function that calls the Gemini model via `firebase_ai`. The prompt will instruct the AI to:
        *   Analyze the user's text.
        *   Reformat it into a clear, concise question.
        *   Assign a `category` from the list in Part 3.2.
        *   Suggest an array of `expected_response_types` (e.g., `['Text Answer', 'Image']`).
    3.  **User Review (Escalation Dialog)**: Display the AI's output in a review dialog (`EscalationDialog`). This dialog will allow the user to:
        *   Edit the AI-formatted question text.
        *   Change the category.
        *   Modify the selection of expected response types.
        *   **Set the `price_credits` for the answer.**
        *   **Set the `sla_expires_at` (time limit) for the answer.**
    4.  **Submission**: Once the user confirms, write the final, structured query object to the `queries` collection, making it visible to human Nodes.
    5.  **Answering UI**: Create the `AnswerQueryDialog` which dynamically builds input fields based on the query's `expected_response_types`.
*   **Your Actions**: Review the entire flow, from raw input to the review dialog and the final submission.
*   **Testing**: 
    *   Unit test the AI processing function to ensure it returns a structured object.
    *   Widget test the `EscalationDialog` to ensure it's editable.
    *   Integration test the full flow: a user asks a question, reviews the AI suggestions, sets a price, and successfully posts it.
*   **Discussion**: "Milestone 2 complete. The core AI-assisted query flow is now implemented. Shall we build the credit economy and wallet system to power the transactions?"

(Remaining Milestones 3-7 will now build upon this more detailed and accurate foundation, but their core objectives remain the same.)

### **Milestone 3: Credit Economy & Wallet**
*   **Objective**: Implement the credit-based economy and the user wallet with Cashfree integration.
*   **My Actions**:

    3.  Build the `/wallet` UI.
*   **Your Actions**: Provide Cashfree API keys; set up the webhook URL in the Cashfree dashboard.
*   **Testing**: Test adding credits; test `Bonus` -> `Cash` spend order; test withdrawal requests.
*   **Discussion**: "Milestone 3 complete. We have a functioning wallet. Ready to implement the trust score and dispute resolution systems?"

### **Milestone 4: Trust Score & Dispute Resolution**
*   **Objective**: Implement the user trust score and the three-way dispute resolution system.
*   **My Actions**:

    2.  Implement the `disputes` collection and the UI for users to raise disputes.
    3.  Implement the Admin UI for resolving disputes.
    4.  Create the `handleDisputeResolution` Cloud Function.
*   **Your Actions**: Review the logic for trust score changes and dispute outcomes.
*   **Testing**: Verify trust scores adjust correctly based on actions; test the full dispute lifecycle from creation to admin resolution.
*   **Discussion**: "Milestone 4 complete. Trust and safety mechanisms are in place. Shall we proceed to build the micro-services marketplace?"

### **Milestone 5: Micro-services Marketplace**
*   **Objective**: Build the marketplace for user-created services and subscriptions.
*   **My Actions**:
    1.  Implement the `services`, `serviceSubscriptions`, and `serviceUpdates` collections.
    2.  Create the UI for users to create, manage, browse, and subscribe to services.
    3.  Implement recurring credit deductions for subscriptions via a scheduled Cloud Function.
*   **Your Actions**: Review the service creation and subscription flow.
*   **Testing**: Test creating a service, subscribing to it, and receiving updates.
*   **Discussion**: "Milestone 5 complete. The services marketplace is functional. Shall we build the admin panel to manage the platform?"

### **Milestone 6: Admin Panel**
*   **Objective**: Build the administrative backend for platform management.
*   **My Actions**:
    1.  Implement the `/admin` page with tabs for "User Management", "Disputed Queries", and "Withdrawal Queue".
